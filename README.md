# Stroke Prediction Model

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence. The training process is implemented in Python using **Google Colab** and explores various machine learning techniques such as **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**, along with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:
   - Analyze data distribution.
   - Check for correlations between features.
   - Identify patterns or anomalies in the dataset.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Use **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** algorithms for stroke prediction.
   - Train and evaluate the models on the provided dataset.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize the models' parameters for better performance.
   - Compare the models using evaluation metrics to determine the best-performing model.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Upload the `ipynb` file to your Google Drive.
   - Open it in Google Colab.

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Ensure the dataset is uploaded or accessible from Colab.
   - Load and preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize data if needed).

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute the cells step-by-step:
     - Perform data analysis.
     - Train models using Decision Tree and Random Forest.
     - Apply hyperparameter tuning.
     - Evaluate and compare the models.

4. **View Results**:
   - Analyze evaluation metrics to select the best model.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Details

The following hyperparameters were tuned for each model:

- **Decision Tree**:
  - `max_depth`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `min_samples_leaf`
  
- **Random Forest**:
  - `n_estimators`
  - `max_depth`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `min_samples_leaf`

Tuning was performed using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV, depending on the computational constraints.

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Indicates the proportion of true positives among actual positives.
- **F1-Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measures the area under the ROC curve for binary classification.

---

## Results

The best-performing model was determined based on the chosen evaluation metrics. Typically, **Random Forest** performs better in terms of both accuracy and generalization due to its ensemble approach.

---

## Future Improvements

- Use more advanced algorithms like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** for comparison.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust performance estimation.
- Expand dataset preprocessing with feature engineering techniques.
